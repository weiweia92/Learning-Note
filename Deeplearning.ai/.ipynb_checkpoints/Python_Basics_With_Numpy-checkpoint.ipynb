    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "- You will be using Python 3.\n",
    "- Avoid using for-loops and while-loops, unless you are explicitly told to do so.\n",
    "- Do not modify the (# GRADED FUNCTION [function name]) comment in some cells. Your work would not be graded if you change this. Each cell containing that comment should only contain one function.\n",
    "- After coding your function, run the cell right below it to check if your result is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**After this assignment you will:**\n",
    "- Be able to use iPython Notebooks\n",
    "- Be able to use numpy functions and numpy matrix/vector operations\n",
    "- Understand the concept of \"broadcasting\"\n",
    "- Be able to vectorize code\n",
